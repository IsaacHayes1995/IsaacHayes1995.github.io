description: Developed a "Just Walk Out" store for linen.
intro:  
  - paragraphs:  
      - "While running High Frequency, SPL approached me with a problem \"We want to break into the short term stay market, and we think RFID can help us do that.\"
         What followed over the next two years was the constant iteration of a \"Just Walk Out\" store for short term stay linen."  
      - "The eco-friendly mobile linen hub is powered entirely by solar power, and its portable design means it can easily be moved, allowing the quick testing of new markets."  
      - "Customers simply walk up and tap their fob to enter. Once inside, the customer selects linen from the trolleys placed in the clean room, and bring the linen they want to the foyer. Linen inside the foyer is scanned, and the customer can simply leave once they are done."  
outro:  
  - paragraphs:  
      - "This is a great example of that fact that RFID in commercial laundries can be leveraged to open up new revenue streams."  
highlights:
  - title: "One of the key learnings from the Mobile Linen Hub was how technology can transform traditional industries."
    paragraphs:
      - "By combining RFID automation with solar-powered mobility, we demonstrated that laundries can operate autonomously, reduce overheads, and access new revenue channels without large capital investments."
      - "This project proved that rapid prototyping and lean infrastructure can unlock new business models in even the most established sectors like commercial laundry."
