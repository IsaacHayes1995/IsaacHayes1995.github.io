description: Developed an augmented reality based app, that allowed customers to use their phone as an RFID reader
intro:  
  - paragraphs:  
      - "In our quest to expand the \"Just walk out \" model of linen hubs, we at SPL were looking for ways to reduce the capital investment required to launch a new store."  
      - "The goal was to develop a way for customers to be able to use their smart phone to scan RFID tags, thus reducing the hardware cost of a new Linen Hub."  
      - "This led to me reconsidering what counted as an 'RFID Scan'."  
outro:  
  - paragraphs:  
      - "TBC"  

highlights:  
  - title: "An RFID scan of a bundle of linen just produces data on the RFID tags it sees, so I just needed to find a way to put that data in a format your phone can read."  
    paragraphs:  
      - "We developed two pieces of technology: An RFID reader application that could read the tags in a bundle of linen, and create a 2D barcode sticker to hold that data. And a cross-platform mobile application that could decode that barcode, and allow the customer to check out that bundle."  
      - "The linen was prepared at the laundry, and shipped to the stores."
      - "The app utilised augmented reality, to display a floating bubble above all the bundles. This clearly indicated to the customer what was in each bundle, and which ones they had added to their cart."
